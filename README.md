# LAB-BOOKING-ATTENDANCE

Some other links for functionality which do not have buttons on the main html webpage to get to yet:
/bookings/all - will display all bookings
/bookings/book - will allow for booking a seat, no link with student as there is no login yet
/id - where id is a number, this will display the details of the student with that id. Will display all details as null or 0 if there is no such student
/students - will display a json list of students, the proper way to view all students is via the display all students button
/id/deleteuser - where id is a number you enter and it is the id of the student you want to delete. It will immediately delete a student. eg /5/deleteuser
